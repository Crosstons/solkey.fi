# Solkey.fi

A project that combines token aggregation, NFT insurance, and flash loans could allow users to pool tokens for flash loans while also insuring NFT assets.

## Team Name - Vanguard

## Why Solkey.fi ?

The need for a platform where users can enter multiple wallet addresses to retrieve and analyse their token holdings with respect to time was high.
So we came up with Harmony Analytics to solve the above mentioned problem with the use of Covalent endpoints and our data manipulation skills.
