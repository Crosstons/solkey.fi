# Solkey.fi
Finalist at Encode Ã— Solana Hackathon'23(Previously known as Clusters)

A DeFi Platform for Solana that does the Token Aggregation, Cluster Marketplace, Offering Flash Loans & NFT insurance at a single place.

## Team Name - Vanguard

### Why Solkey.Fi ?

Solkey.fi is inspired from the Set Protocol on Ethereum, but we levelled it up with our flash loans. The lying around token liquidity of a token aggregation platform can be used for providing flash loans and we just accomplished that with our Clusters and Flash Loans. Along with that if you want to buy a Cluster (Multiple Tokens Into One) at a definite price, you can do that too from our Cluster Marketplace. <br />
Worried about the floor price of your NFTs? What if they were backed by other tokens which act as an insurance for the price of your NFTs. If the price drops below your comfort zone, you can always claim the insurance by burning the NFT and getting the backed tokens into your wallet.
